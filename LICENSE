1. Create/rename your repo (e.g. to `run-for-good` or keep `Ascot-Hills-5k-RUN-Challenge` renamed via GitHub Settings → Repository name).
2. In the repo root → **Add file** → name it `README.md`
3. Paste the content above → Commit with message: "Add initial README.md aligned with PRD"
4. Also add `PRD.md` (paste our full refined PRD from previous messages) and `.env.example` (create with placeholders).

Once done:
- Reply here: “Repo setup complete – name is Blueavian9/RunForGood
- We’ll immediately start **Epic 0** with the first concrete code/files (e.g. layout.tsx, Header component).

This README gives your repo instant professionalism, clarity, and keeps you locked to the PRD plan.

Ready when you are!
